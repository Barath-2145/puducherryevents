                            Dating its history back to at least 500 years ago, the Arulmigu Manakula Vinayagar Temple has 2 interesting tales attached to it. It is said that, during the French rule, the French people built a fort right beside the temple in the year 1688.

                            To make an impact on their fort, they thought of removing the Vinayagar Temple from its current position and hence, started throwing the idol of Ganesha in the sea. But to their surprise, every time they did, the idol used to reappear on its own. Seeing this, the French people gave up and became the ardent follower of the Lord.

                            Another ancient story that revolves around this temple states that, almost around 300 years ago, there was a saint who had glittering eyes and wide forehead attained samadhi at this divine site through his liberation. Since then, it is considered as an auspicious place for newborn babies.

        <h5 style="color:brown">Architecture of Arulmigu Manakula Vinayagar Temple:</h5>

        Featuring a traditional Dravidian Architecture that deserves high praise, the Arulmigu Manakula Vinayagar Temple is beautifully decorated with an array of friezes and stucco figurines that make the overall structure look even more impressive.<br />
        <div style="padding:4px"></div>
        Sprawling over an area of 7913 square feet, the main highlight of this temple is the gold laminated kodi kambam that measures 18 feet in height. Another interesting feature is the idol of Lord Ganesha that rests on the golden chariot. Made entirely of teak wood and gold racks, the golden chariot was created solely from the donations given by the devotees in the temple. Just for the fact, the total gold used in the making of this chariot is 7.5 kg and it costs approximately 75 lakhs.<br />
        <div style="padding:4px"></div>
        The beautiful architectural design also features a mandapam, a prahara, and raja gopuram where the statues of the deities are kept. Besides Ganesha, one can also find the idols of several other important gods and goddesses inside the temple including Shri Krishna, Murugan, Shiva, Parvati, and many more. Other than that, there is also an elephant Lakshmi that blesses people with her trunk every day from 4:00 PM until 8:00 PM in the evening.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Veerampattinam is a fishing village and a man named Veeraraghavan was living there in an ancient time. One fine morning, he set out for fishing in a nearby rivulet. He had no catch till sunset and was totally disappointed but he didn’t give up and made a final attempt before he returned home. When he was withdrawing the net, he was very happy as he felt a heavy resistant which is usually due to a big catch. But he disappointed eventually as there was no fish instead it was a big piece of wood. He took it home and kept it in the backyard.

                            One day his wife found no firewood for cooking and decided to cut the wood to make it useful. When she hit the wood with an axe, it was shocking and she couldn’t believe it as blood was oozing out from the axe cut. She immediately informed her husband and the villagers. Astonished Veeraraghavan kept the wood inside his home and started performing pooja. He was very happy and life became prosperous for him.

                            After some days, Amman (Lady God) appeared in Veeraraghavan’s dream and told him that you got the wood because of my blessings. She asked him to use the wood as Peeta (Base) and to install her idol on the base at a specific location in the village. She asked him to workship the idol as "Sengazhuneer Amman" before disappearing from his dream.

                            Veeraraghavan informed the villagers about his dream. All the villagers set out to find the place indicated by Amman. They found an ant-hill from where a serpent (cobra) came out and beat the ground thrice with its hood, thus showing them the place where they had to establish the idol. The wood was brought for setting the peeta and made a granite idol of Sengazhuneer Amman head.

                            The temple was gradually developed stage by stage from a small hut to a huge temple over the centuries. A temple car was made centuries ago and it was the first temple in the province of Puducherry to have a temple car.

                            The main Villianur Temple shrine is said to be about 1000 years old. It was constructed in the 12th century CE, by a Chola king.

                            As per the legends, the king was suffering from leprosy. But he was cured, after he worshipped Lord Shiva here. So, he constructed the temple and established this Vilwanallur town (named after the surrounding forest of Vilwa trees).

                            His Chola successors and rulers of the Vijayanagar Empire added other structures later. The masonry is believed to be built during the 16th century.

                <p>In 1867, the MEP missionaries in Puducherry wished to build a Chapel at Villianur which is 13 kilometers from Pondicherry, on the road to Villupuram. Hence they bought a piece of land at Villianur and Rev.Fr.Gou, then procurator of the Puducherry mission after a long negotiation with the Hindu temple authorities of Thirukameswarer Gogilambigai Temple started to build a Chapel at Kanuvapet on the outskirts of Villianur. It is said that the building of the church was sponsored by the thanksgiving offering of Dr.Lephine's family for the miraculous cure of his daughter. It took 10 years to complete the Chapel. And Rev.Fr.Tarbes a cousin brother of St. Bernadette, the visionary of Lourdes, was appointed as the Parish Priest of Villianur mission. Since he had a direct report of the apparitions of Our Lady of Lourdes, this chapel is the first in the world to be named after Our Lady of Lourdes outside Lourdes, France. </p>
